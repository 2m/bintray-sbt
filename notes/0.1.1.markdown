## enhancements

- added `bintrayOrganization` key for optionally publishing to a bintray organization rather than a user account

    bintray.Keys.bintrayOrganization in bintray.Keys.bintray := Some("strenth-in-numbers")
    
- publishing sbt plugins to bintray is now possible

In your plugin's build definition, add the following

   sbtPlugin := true
   
   seq(bintraySettings:_*)   

That's it!

Be sure to document the following requirement for consumers of your plugins to include the following resolver. This only needs appended once.

    resolvers += Resolver.url(
      "bintray-sbt-plugin-releases",
      url("http://dl.bintray.com/content/sbt/sbt-plugin-releases"))(
        Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
