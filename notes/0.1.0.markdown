## initial release

Intoduce your sbt console to [bintry](https://bintray.com/), a free publishing platform that puts you in control of your binaries. 

Bintray allows users to `link` packages to other repositories, say [jcenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) an analog to mavencentral for instance.

Get going by creating and account on bintray and installing bintray-sbt by adding the following to your sbt plugins.sbt file

    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "bintry-sbt" % "0.1.0")
    
And in your build definition

    seq(bintraySettings:_*)
    
Not a publisher? No problem. Add the following instead

    seq(bintrayResolverSettings:_*)
    
This will automatically add `jcenter` to your resolver chain.
