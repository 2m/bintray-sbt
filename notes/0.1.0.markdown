## initial release

Intoduce your sbt console to [bintray](https://bintray.com/), a free publishing platform that puts you in control of your binaries. 

Bintray allows users to `link` published packages to other repositories.  You may request your package be linked and aggregating repository like [jcenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter), an analog to mavencentral, so your users will fewer resolvers in their dependency resolution chain while you still get to maintain ownership over your packages hosting.

Get going by creating and account on bintray and installing bintray-sbt by adding the following to a sbt `plugins.sbt` file in your project's `project` directory.

    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "bintray-sbt" % "0.1.0")
    
Then mix in the bintray-sbt settings to your projects build definition, usually a `build.sbt` file in a project's root directory.

    seq(bintraySettings:_*)
    
Not a publisher? No problem. Add the following instead

    seq(bintrayResolverSettings:_*)
    
This will automatically add [jcenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) to your resolver chain.

Your publisher only publishes to their own bintray repo? Add the following to your build definition

    bintray.Opts.resolver("bintray-username", "bintray-repo")
