## fixes

* published artifacts now use the `moduleName` sbt setting rather than `name`. This fixes some normalization when you specify unconventional project names.

## features

* [PGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) sign your published artifacts remotely

Store PGP credentials on [bintray](http://blog.bintray.com/2013/08/06/fight-crime-with-gpg/) so that you can sign artifacts from anywhere. You can do so with the `remoteSign` sbt task

    bintray::remoteSign
    
Note, this is a voluntary action. It does not run when you publish. publish first, then remoteSign.
