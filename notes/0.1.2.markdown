## fixes

* published artifacts now use the `moduleName` sbt setting rather than `name`. This fixes some normalization when you specify unconventional project names.

## features

* [PGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) sign your published artifacts remotely

Store PGP credentials on [bintray](http://blog.bintray.com/2013/08/06/fight-crime-with-gpg/) so that you can sign artifacts from anywhere. You can do so with the `remoteSign` sbt task

    bintray::remoteSign
    
Note, this is a voluntary action. It does not run when you publish, publish first, then remoteSign.

* sync to maven central

Have your bintray published artifacts [synced with maven central](http://blog.bintray.com/2014/02/11/bintray-as-pain-free-gateway-to-maven-central/). You can do so with the the `syncMavenCentral` task

    bintray::syncMavenCentral
    
Note, this is a voluntary action. Syncing packages to [mvn central](http://search.maven.org/) has some extra requirements. Most are covered in the article linked above.

* specify bintray api credentials inline or with sbt's built-in credentials interface

To specfiy credentials inline you can do so with the `bintrayCredentials` setting as follows

    bintray.Keys.bintrayCredentials in bintray.Keys.bintray := Some(bintray.BintrayCredentials(username, apiToken))
    
or within sbt's built-in credential store (this can also be a path reference)

    credentials += Credentials(
       "Bintray API Realm",
       "api.bintray.com",
       username, apiToken
    )
