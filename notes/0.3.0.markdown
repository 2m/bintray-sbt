## changes

* auto plugins friendly. this plugin is now automatically enabled if it is added in plugins.sbt, no need to reference bintraySettings
* auto-imported keys. Keys no longer need refered to under the `bintray.Keys` namespace in your custom configuration
* all keys are typically prefixed with `bintray` now to be more inline with current sbt plugin interface trends
* `bintrayOrganization` now defaults to the name associated with your bintray credentials, including in the sbtPlugin case
* `bintrayRepository` now defaults to sbt-plugins, not sbt-plugin-releases to be more inline with the [sbt docs](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Bintray-For-Plugins.html)
