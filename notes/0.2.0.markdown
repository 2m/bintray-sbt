## changes

* support for `unlicensed` packages /via [@knshiro](https://github.com/knshiro)

Bintray requires that all published packages are associated with a named [license](https://bintray.com/docs/api/#_footnote_1). Under some circumstances a given package may wish to opt out of this. For these cases, you may now specify your sbt `licenses` setting with a value of "Unlicense". See [unlicense.org](http://unlicense.org/) for more information.

* support for omitting license /via [@ulejon](https://github.com/ulejon)

Owners of private (premium) bintray repo's may opt out of specifying an sbt `licenses` setting when publishing to bintray altogether by setting the new bintray setting `omitLicense` setting to `true`.

* added deprecation notices

Sbt now defines resolver factories `sbt.Resolver.jcenterRepo` and `sbt.Resolver.bintrayRepo` which both obviate the need for `bintray.Opts.resolver.jcenter` and `bintray.Opts.resolver.repo` respectively. They will both be removed from this plugin in upcoming releases. The resolver factories for bintray have also added support for https in this release.

* bintrayPublishSettings now includes bintrayCommonSettings

It was a mistake not doing this in the first place. `bintrayCommonSettings` appends `changeCredentials` and `whoami` tasks. For the best experience, it is recommended to start with `bintraySettings` and override the defaults as needed.
